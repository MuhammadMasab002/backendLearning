## Branching Strategy

The convention to follow for branch naming is as follows:

- <developer-name>/<type>/<branch-name>

where type => feat / fix / bug / style / test / doc / chore / refactor

### Commit Strategy

The Git commit messages need to follow the following format:

- <type>(<scope>)
- what: <description of work done>
- impact: <impact on codebase and app>

where

- type => feat / fix / bug / style / test / doc / chore / refactor
- scope => feature or code section it relates to
- impact => high / medium / low
